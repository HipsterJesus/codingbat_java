/**
 * AP1Test
 *
 * AP CS medium problems.
 * These problems are based on free response questions from old AP CS-A exams, 2004 and later.
 * Some are from the exams and some were just created to have a similar difficulty.
 * These problems are good practice for the logic/loop/array aspects of the exam.
