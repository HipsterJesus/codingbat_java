 * Recursion1
 *
 * Basic recursion problems.
 * Recursion strategy: first test for one or two base cases that are so simple,
 * the answer can be returned immediately.
 * Otherwise, make a recursive a call for a smaller case
 * (that is, a case which is a step towards the base case).
 * Assume that the recursive call works correctly,
 * and fix up what it returns to make the answer.
